# Generattiv_CircularMotion
Generative artwork - Circular Motion

Using polar coordinates, a given number of circles are created, each with a slight offset to form a quasi-circular shape.
This was accomplished by varying the values of the polar coordinates of each circle created by perlin noise.

With the application of perlin noise again, the radii between circles are continually shifting.
To create this effect, the circles appear to be in continual motion as time passes, with varying radii and arc shapes.

This began as a study of perlin noise and circles, but was eventually expanded into an audio reactive graphic.
